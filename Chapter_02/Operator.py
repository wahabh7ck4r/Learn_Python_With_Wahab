# Arthamatic operator

print("The value of a + b is: ", a + b)
print("The value of a - b is: ", a - b)
print("The value of a * b is: ", a * b)

# Comparision operator 
print("Check if a is equal to b :", a == b)
print("Check if a is not equal to b :", a != b)
print("Check if a is greater to b :", a > b)
print("Check if a is lesser to b :", a < b)  # We can also use grater than or equal and lessthan or equal to.

# Assignment operator 
x = 5  # we assign 5 to x , SO assignment operator is used to give a value to a variable 
# we can also assign a variable to a vaiable like: 
y = x 
print(y)

# logical operator 
Condition1 = True
Condition2 = False

print("Conditon1 and Condition2: " , Condition1 and Condition2) # if both are true then the output is true otherwise flase

print("Conditon1 or Condition2: " , Condition1 or Condition2) # if only one condition is true then the output is true.

print("not condition2 : " ,  not Condition2) # if the conition is true it wll make it false an if false it will make it true.
