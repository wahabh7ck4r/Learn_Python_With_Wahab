# create a list to store furits 
furits  = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango',  'orange']

# now i wnat to acces these all one by one what should i do the this thing i cna do is to print eacn one by one like this:
print(furits[0]) #than

for furit in furits:
    print(furit)   #it print each item one by one in sequence.
